        <h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I hope you are well. I have been thinking about you lately and wanted to take a moment to express my admiration, kindness and love.</p>
<p>You are an extraordinary girl, I have no more words to tell you that you are special to me. I also admire your resilience and your ability to overcome challenges with determination. I am proud to know you.</p>
<p>I hope that soon we will have the opportunity to meet. In the meantime, know that I am thinking of you and wish you all the best. I won't be the most handsome or strongest man for you, but, you will have me for the rest of your life, if that's what fate wills.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,
Fred</p>
